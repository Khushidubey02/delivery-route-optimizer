# Delivery Route Optimizer

This project finds the shortest path for deliveries using Dijkstra’s algorithm on graphs.

## What I Learned
- Dijkstra’s algorithm
- Working with graphs in Java
- Using PriorityQueue to get shortest distances

## Tech Stack
- Java
- Graph (Adjacency List)
- Dijkstra Algorithm

## How it works
- Each node is a delivery point
- Graph has edges with distances
- Starting from a source, find shortest path to all other nodes
